Text-to-MindMap Conversion System

Overview:

This repository hosts a Text-to-MindMap Conversion System, a tool designed to analyze and visualize the relationships between key sentences and phrases within a given text or paragraph. By employing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the system identifies the most significant components of the text and organizes them into an intuitive mind map. This tool is especially useful for educators, students, researchers, or anyone looking to quickly grasp the central ideas and their interconnections within a piece of writing.
