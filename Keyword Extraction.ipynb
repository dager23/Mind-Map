    "myText = '''artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition. All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated insect behaviour is never taken as an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus. When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the threshold, checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp’s instinctual behaviour is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced. Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of Sphex—must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances. Psychologists generally do not characterize human intelligence by just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities. Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and using language. There are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence. An example of the former is, “Fred must be in either the museum or the café. He is not in the café; therefore he is in the museum, and of the latter, Previous accidents of this sort were caused by instrument failure; therefore this accident was caused by instrument failure. The most significant difference between these forms of reasoning is that in the deductive case the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion, whereas in the inductive case the truth of the premise lends support to the conclusion without giving absolute assurance. Inductive reasoning is common in science, where data are collected and tentative models are developed to describe and predict future behaviour—until the appearance of anomalous data forces the model to be revised. Deductive reasoning is common in mathematics and logic, where elaborate structures of irrefutable theorems are built up from a small set of basic axioms and rules. There has been considerable success in programming computers to draw inferences, especially deductive inferences. However, true reasoning involves more than just drawing inferences; it involves drawing inferences relevant to the solution of the particular task or situation. This is one of the hardest problems confronting AI. Artificial intelligence systems are critical for companies that wish to extract value from data by automating and optimizing processes or producing actionable insights. Artificial intelligence systems powered by machine learning enable companies to leverage large amounts of available data to uncover insights and patterns that would be impossible for any one person to identify, enabling them to deliver more targeted, personalized communications, predict critical care events, identify likely fraudulent transactions, and more. DataRobot was founded on the belief that emerging AI and machine learning technologies should be available to all enterprises, regardless of size and resources. That’s why we invented automated machine learning, which allows users of all skill levels to easily and rapidly build and deploy machine learning models.\n",
    "DataRobot believes in the democratization of AI, and for that reason, we developed a platform to enable business users across organizations to gain actionable, practical insights that result in tangible business value. DataRobot makes the power of AI accessible to users throughout your business, helping your organization transform into an AI-driven enterprise.'''"

    " 3: 'artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasksâ€”as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chessâ€”with great proficiency.Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and using language.There are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence.An example of the former is, â€œFred must be in either the museum or the cafÃ©.',\n",

    " 5: 'The real nature of the waspâ€™s instinctual behaviour is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced.Intelligenceâ€”conspicuously absent in the case of Sphexâ€”must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.Psychologists generally do not characterize human intelligence by just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities.This is one of the hardest problems confronting AI.Artificial intelligence systems are critical for companies that wish to extract value from data by automating and optimizing processes or producing actionable insights.Artificial intelligence systems powered by machine learning enable companies to leverage large amounts of available data to uncover insights and patterns that would be impossible for any one person to identify, enabling them to deliver more targeted, personalized communications, predict critical care events, identify likely fraudulent transactions, and more.',\n",

    " 7: 'What is the difference?Consider the behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus.When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the threshold, checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside.',\n",
    " 8: 'Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge.On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated insect behaviour is never taken as an indication of intelligence.',\n",
    " 9: 'DataRobot was founded on the belief that emerging AI and machine learning technologies should be available to all enterprises, regardless of size and resources.Thatâ€™s why we invented automated machine learning, which allows users of all skill levels to easily and rapidly build and deploy machine learning models.'}"
